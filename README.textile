h2. How to Contribute

In general http://help.github.com/ is very helpful, but it is not always clear what order you should do things in, so here goes.

A quick* guide for people who've never used github:

    * install git 
    * make your account on github
    * set up an ssh key pair http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect
    * set up user name, email and GitHub token http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/
    * fork it, make changes, push those changes http://help.github.com/forking/

*please let us know if it is not clear enough or needs improvement. Thanks!
